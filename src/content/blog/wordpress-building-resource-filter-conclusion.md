              When we started building the resource filtering system for reDesignED, our goal was straightforward: help users find educational resources quickly and intuitively. What emerged was a deeper understanding of how user experience, code organization, and security intertwine in modern web development.

              ## Key insights

              **Code organization matters**. By separating our code into focused components - the main template orchestrating the flow, individual parts handling specific displays, and centralized functions managing common operations - we created a system that's both maintainable and extensible.

              **User experience drives technical decisions**. Our choice to show only valid filter combinations wasn't just a UI preference; it shaped our entire filtering logic. Following the user's natural selection path - knowing their current choice must be valid and using that to determine next available options - led to both better code and a more intuitive interface.

              **Security requires consistency**. By centralizing our URL generation and security token handling, we ensured that every user interaction is properly protected. What started as a simple filtering system evolved to include thoughtful security measures without compromising usability.

              The resulting system serves its purpose well: users can efficiently find resources through various combinations of filters, never encountering frustrating dead ends or confusing results. For developers, the code provides a template for building similar systems, with clear separation of concerns and robust security measures.

              Perhaps the most valuable lesson is that seemingly simple features often reveal layers of complexity when built thoughtfully. By embracing this complexity while maintaining clean, organized code, we create systems that serve both users and developers effectively.
