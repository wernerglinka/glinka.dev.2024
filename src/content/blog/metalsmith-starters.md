              I just released three new Metalsmith starters to help new and old Metalsmith hands to get started quickly with their projects. 

              ## A Bare-bones Starter
              When you are just starting this may help.

              - Code at https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-bare-bones-starter
              - Demo at https://metalsmith-bare-bones-starter.netlify.app/

              ## A Blog Starter
              Adding a blog to your Metalsmith site is not difficult.

              - Code at https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-blog-starter
              - Demo at https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-blog-starter

              ## A Company Website Starter
              Company websites are normally more complex than your average portfolio or blog site. Here is a starter that inlcudes flexible page layouts, a responsive/progressive image component and more.

              - Code at https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-company-starter
              - Demo at https://metalsmith-company-starter.netlify.app/
