    Samples of my work. Most of the websites that I have build are for small to medium size companies but I have also build sites for non-profit organizations pro bono, from the Peninsula Museum of Art to TechnovationMN. Non-profits that could benefit from a website, please reach out to me.

            prose: >-
              Here is a selection of my completed projects. The work I've undertaken spans across a variety of sectors, but primarily caters to small and medium-sized enterprises. All websites have been build to reflect a company's vision, ethos, and market positioning.


              Notably, my portfolio isn't confined to commercial endeavors. I firmly believe in using my skills and resources to give back to the community. In line with this belief, I have undertaken several pro bono assignments for non-profit organizations. Each one has offered a different, yet equally rewarding, experience. 


              A standout example is the website I designed for the [Peninsula Museum of Art](https://www.peninsulamuseum.org/). This project was an opportunity to blend my love for the arts with my passion for web development. I am proud to have contributed to a platform that promotes art appreciation and education.


              Another key pro bono project was for [Technovation[MN]](https://technovationmn.org/). The organization champions technology education for young women, a cause I wholeheartedly support. Developing their website was not just a project, but a contribution to a mission that strives to close the gender gap in the technology sector.


              My latest pro bono project was for the [Mental Health America of California](https://www.mhanc.org/). This organization is dedicated to promoting mental health and wellness. I was honored to be able to contribute to their cause by creating a website that would help them reach a wider audience and provide support to those in need.


              These experiences have been incredibly enriching and have expanded the scope of my expertise while providing me the satisfaction of contributing positively to society.
