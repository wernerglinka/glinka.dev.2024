              My work centers on Metalsmith, a static site generator that distinguishes itself through architectural simplicity and extensibility.

              The plugin-based architecture sets Metalsmith apart from monolithic generators like Gatsby or Hugo. Each plugin performs a focused transformation, making the build process modular and comprehensible. Complex functionality emerges from combining simple, single-purpose plugins rather than navigating opaque internal systems.
                  
              This transparency extends to plugin development. Creating custom plugins requires understanding just one pattern: accept a files object, transform it, return it. This simplicity enables rapid prototyping and encourages experimentation.

              Segment created Metalsmith in early 2014, establishing its foundational architecture. After the initial development phase, the project entered a quieter period until 2022, when Kevin Van Lierde AKA [webketje](https://github.com/webketje) assumed leadership as maintainer. Under his stewardship, Metalsmith has returned to active development with regular updates, modernized tooling, and renewed community engagement.

              Since 2023, my Metalsmith work has evolved to incorporate AI collaboration. After experimenting with various tools including [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/), [Github Co-pilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [Augment Code](https://www.augmentcode.com/), I've settled on [Claude](https://claude.ai/) and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) as primary development partners. This collaboration accelerates plugin development, improves code quality through pair programming patterns, and enables rapid exploration of architectural approaches.

              The combination of Metalsmith's transparent architecture and AI assistance creates an efficient development environment. The AI understands the plugin patterns quickly, while Metalsmith's simplicity makes the generated code easy to verify and refine.

              As I integrate AI co-programming into my development workflow, I'm exploring ways to enhance AI assistants with Metalsmith-specific knowledge. MCP servers provide exactly this capability.

              MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers act as bridges between AI models and specialized resources. They enable AI assistants to access files, databases, and APIs while providing domain-specific expertise. Think of them as knowledge extensions that give AI models contextual understanding of specific tools and frameworks.

              **[Metalsmith Plugin MCP Server](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-plugin-mcp-server):**
              This server streamlines Metalsmith plugin development by encoding ecosystem best practices directly into the AI's context. It provides automated scaffolding, validation, and maintenance tools that follow established patterns from core Metalsmith plugins and successful community contributions.

              The server offers comprehensive plugin lifecycle support. It generates complete plugin structures with proper testing frameworks, documentation templates, and configuration files. The validation system checks plugins against quality standards derived from exemplary projects like @metalsmith/core-plugin and metalsmith-optimize-images.

              Over the years, I've created several plugins that I've made available to the community. I also frequently contribute to existing plugins. All my plugins and starters  are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wernerglinka) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~wernerglinka). Here are a few of my projects:

              **[Metalsmith Bundled Components](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-bundled-components):**
              This plugin automates asset management for component-based architectures through intelligent discovery and bundling. It scans component directories for CSS and JavaScript files, resolves dependencies with circular reference detection, and generates correctly-ordered bundles with scope isolation through IIFEs. The plugin supports both ESM and CommonJS modules, integrates with PostCSS for CSS processing, and follows convention-over-configuration principles to minimize setup complexity.

              **[Metalsmith Optimize Images](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-optimize-images):** 
              This plugin automates responsive image generation by creating optimized variants for modern web delivery. It processes source images into multiple resolutions for different device widths while generating next-generation AVIF and WebP formats alongside JPEG/PNG fallbacks for universal browser support.

              **[Metalsmith Optimize HTML](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-optimize-html):**
              This plugin optimizes HTML output through comprehensive minification without external dependencies. Inspired by the battle-tested [htmlcompressor](https://code.google.com/archive/p/htmlcompressor/) project, it removes unnecessary whitespace, comments, and redundant attributes while normalizing URLs, boolean attributes, and data attributes to reduce file sizes.         


              **[Metalsmith MDN](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-mdn):**
              This plugin bridges the gap between structured templates and long-form content by enabling Nunjucks components within markdown files. It allows you to embed the same reusable components used in your page templates directly into markdown content, maintaining consistency across your entire site.


              **[Metalsmith Markdown Partials](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-markdown-partials):** 
              This plugin enables content composition through reusable markdown fragments. It processes include markers in your markdown files, replacing them with content from separate partial files during the build process. This approach eliminates content duplication across pages while maintaining pure markdown authoring.

              **[Metalsmith Unified Markdown](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-unified-markdown):**
              This plugin explores markdown processing through the [unified/remark ecosystem](https://unifiedjs.com/), demonstrating an alternative architectural approach to the standard [@metalsmith/markdown](https://github.com/metalsmith/markdown) plugin. While fully functional, it prioritizes extensibility and ecosystem integration over raw performance.

              **[Metalsmith Blog Lists](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-blog-lists):** 
              This tool adds metadata lists, such as 'All Blogs', 'Recent Blogs', 'Featured Blogs', and an 'Annualized Blogs List', which can be accessed by all pages. These lists are useful for creating widgets to promote featured or latest blog posts. Please note that this plugin requires all blog posts to be located in the 'blog/' directory of the content.


              **[Metalsmith Safe Links](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-safe-links):** 
              This plugin automatically processes links in your content to handle internal and external URLs appropriately. For internal links, it converts absolute URLs to relative paths by removing unnecessary protocol and hostname information. For external links, it adds security and usability attributes including target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer". The plugin solves a common markdown limitation: standard markdown link syntax only supports href and title attributes. 


              **[Metalsmith Prism](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-prism):** 
              This plugin integrates [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) syntax highlighting into the Metalsmith build process, automatically processing code blocks to add language-specific styling without client-side JavaScript dependencies. The plugin supports Prism's extensive language collection and theme options while maintaining the performance benefits of build-time processing.

              Originally developed by Robert McGuinness with sponsorship from Availity, I assumed maintenance responsibilities in March 2022. Under my stewardship, the plugin has been updated for compatibility with current Metalsmith versions and modern Node.js environments, ensuring continued reliability for technical documentation and developer-focused sites.


              **[Metalsmith Static Files](https://github.com/wernerglinka/metalsmith-static-files):** 
              This plugin handles static asset management in Metalsmith projects, copying directories of unchanging files—images, fonts, downloads, vendor scripts—directly from source to build without processing. It provides fine-grained control over which directories to copy and where to place them in the build output.

              Created as a modern replacement for the deprecated metalsmith-assets plugin, it maintains compatibility with current Metalsmith versions while adding improved error handling and clearer configuration options. The plugin streamlines asset management by keeping static files separate from processed content, preventing unnecessary processing overhead and maintaining clean project organization.
